# Testing environments
because computers hate me

(1) You will need to create a new environment with the following packages: python 3.10, nengo 3.2, tensorflow 2.10.1, nengo-dl 3.6.0, nengo-gui, black[jupyter], matplotlib, and scikit-learn. The process to do so is to create a new environment, activate the environment, then download the packages using requirements.txt. 

If you are using conda, these commands should do the trick:
`conda create --name py3.10-nengo3.2 python=3.10` -- This command gives your new environment a name of *py3.10-nengo3.2*
`conda activate py3.10-nengo3.2` -- This command activates the environment so that you can install other programs within that environment. You'll see the name inside of your brackets change from *base* to the name of your new environment.

If you are not using conda, these commands should work:
Windows:
**i need help here**

Linux/Mac:
**i need help here**

Once you have activated your environment, cd to the directory in which your requirements.txt is stored, then run the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

(XX) Fork this repository.

(XX) From your activated terminal, launch VS code: `code .`

(XX) Open nengoDNN_ICE2.ipynb. Follow the instructions within the notebook to edit the code. 

(XX) Run Black to check your code for minor errors and improper formatting using the following command (I did this in the terminal within VS code):
`black --check .`
If the output does not say "All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú® 1 file would be left unchanged.", you'll need to edit the code to resolve the issue. You can take a look at how Black would reformat your code using `black --diff .` Edit the code accordingly to resolve the issue and run again. Repeat until the output is "All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú® 1 file would be left unchanged.". You could also simply run `black .` to automatically make the changes, but I strongly recommend you understand what changes are made prior to submitting your file. For troubleshooting and more ways to use Black: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html

(XX) Upload your GitHub repository into Gradescope under "ICE1 - DNN" assignment by TX, 1159. If the autograder fails, you did not successfully run Black. You can resubmit as many times as needed prior to the due date. You are also encouraged to schedule time for EI to debug as needed: [Book here](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/94f514961fa3476ab9598d4a2173d076@afacademy.af.edu?anonymous&ep=plink)
